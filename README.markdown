Saint Ignucious on leave from the Church of Emacs

Bumblebuzz is the headmaster at Pigpox. Everybody thinks that he thinks that
everybody thinks that he's insane so that everybody will think that he's
secretly brilliant. Perhaps his masked brilliance is really just another cover
for his secret insanity and everything is exactly as it seems.

Mysteries
=========

Miri
----

You intercept an intermittent DRADIS distress beacon coming from deep within the
forbidden forest. You trace the signal to an overgrown, foreboding strcture

There is a delapidated school deep in the recesses of the forbidden forest.
At its gate stands a plaque that reads simply "Miri".

It is nearly identical to Pigpox
